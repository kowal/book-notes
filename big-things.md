### Rules for big projects

- Think (plan) slow, act fast
- Keep asking "Why?", not loose main goal from sight
- Use simulations, proof of concepts, tests, models until possible & iterate on them (this is still planning phase!)
- Favour experience in people and technology (Lindy effect)
- Take outside view (find your class of project, learn from it)
- Sync the team(s) to be single organism
- Know your building blocks (modularisation, fractal architecture)
- Watch your downside: time is window for black swans (and costs)
