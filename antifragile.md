If you like the notes, go ahead and [buy the book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13530973-antifragile)!

### Overview

- About systems dynamics, risk management and **learning from mistakes**

### What he is critisising?

- Taleb is **against naive interventionism (not all of it)**. Often interventionism focuses on less (or none) important aspects (because it is easier) and hides real problems behind the smaller ones

- **Iatrogenies**. He points out that medicine doctors 1-2 centuries ago was too vain to admin mistakes and therefore they were causing much more pain and problems then amount of actual help for people (jatrogeny). Today that problem is still there. It might produce less mortality and smaller but more hidden health issues. Solution: avoid doctors for small issues, find one in case of real emergency. This rule, known as "barbells techniq" can be applied to other domains.

### What he defends?

- Taleb verbalizes all our internal feelings and hunches as **heuristics**, which can be explained in the context of antifragile systems. He criticies people who underestimate that kind of approach becauase this was working for milenia before scientific revolution and shouldn't be ignored
- Interesting view on **religion** and explanation of religious behaviors as strategies good enough to bring benefits without need of undestanding the mechanics
- Taleb main idea is that - complex systems (organism, health, social systems, nations, politics) are so complex that **it's better to admit it and allow/leverage some level of randomness because it's safer in the long term**.
    - The whole point is to know how much randomness is good. It's hard but that doesn't mean that we should avoid randomness at all.
    - A lot of Taleb ideas might be actually close to The Long Now project. When examining them in our current context, they might feel very bad and not centered around particular people. I think when approaching this book, we should constantly remind ourselves that most of this ideas apply when you're thinking about systems in long-term perspective. Personally I think this is exactly the reason why people kind of ignore him (or that kind of approach) and why it so hard to plan in such way.
- intervention by subtraction, not adding

### Other ideas

- Avoiding decision is also some kind of decision, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fabian_Society
- It is important to be open to options, not make decisions to soon.
- Avoid situations, which has very small probability, but enourmous impact when they happen
- Problems with science - in particular with confirmation bias and taking correlation as implication too often.
- He thinks that most of innovations doesn't come from universities / theory, but from engineers, people who try various things and make a lot of mistakes.
- Randomness and options could be in some cases replacement strategy for knowledge.

### What was confusing for me?

- Taleb seems not to see that what he assumes as ignorance about antifragile systems can be in fact antifragile from the level above. People right now tend to favor stable (but short-term) solutions, however looking at this from distance, the whole society can learn from their mistakes later, at some point. In other words - even if he is 100% right in his claims, people (or governments) won't just take his advice - some units need to fail in order that other (on the same level) can learn and other (on the upper level) can be more antifragile.
- If think he is really smart guy and knows it, however I' not sure his approach would scale if everyone took it.
- The whole tone of this book could be more humble. That would help him find more readers and spread really important ideas even further. On the other hand, his arrogant tone, might be actually the best strategy for spreading the information ..
