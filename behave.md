#### Causes of our behavior

- **Brain**
  - Hippocampus
  - Amygdala
    - most involved when **feeling afraid** / anxious and in **generating aggression**
    - default is to trust, amygdala **learns vigilance and distrust** (which have to be unlearned actively)
    - **stress makes it easier** to learn smth associatted with fear
    - help to remember details, which triggers aggression
  - Neoriplasticity
    - ```experience, health, and hormone fluctuations can change the size of parts of the brain in a matter of months. Experience can also cause long-lasting changes in the numbers of receptors for neurotransmitters and hormones, in levels of ion channels, and in the state of on/off switches on genes in the brain```
- **Hormones**
  - Testosterone
    - does not create aggresion directly, it **amplifies and exacerbate preexisting tendencies**
    - (primates) rise when a dominance **hierarchy is initially formed** or being reorganized
    - (humans) rise during sport challenge (individual or team competitions), increasses among winners
    - even watching your "team" - it is about **dominance, group identification**
    - when rises **after a challenge, it activates behaviors needed to maintain status** (not nessesary aggresion)
  - Oxytocin
    - (female mammals) central to **nursing** (to want to nurse a child and remember which one is their)
    - activates **prosocial behaviors** & released when experience prosocial behavior
- **Genes**
  - Genes are relevant to .. basically everything. They regulate hormones, neurotransmitters and their receptors. Genes are low-level layer of configuration and orchestration
  - not all of the DNA form genes, only 5% of it represents coding genes. Rest is inactive, however it is like meta code, which decides which genes should be activated or deactivated; before each gene there is a promoter (on/off switch) which activates given transcription factor.
  - ```The later a particular brain region matures, the less it is shaped by genes and the more by environment```
  - Genes can work in particular environment, ```.. donâ€™t ask what a gene does; ask what it does in a particular environment```, see [MAO-A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3105117/) - ```Having the low-activity version of MAO-A tripled the likelihood (of antisocial behavior) but only in people with a history of severe childhood abuse```
  - there is something like epigenetically mediated mechanisms of inheritance - after all Jean-Baptiste Lamarck wasn't so wrong about his famous heredity claims (this is still very controversial subject)
- **Aspects of behavior**
  - Risk-taking
    - major stressors make people of both genders more risk taking
    - moderate stressors bias men toward, and women away from, risk taking
    - In the absence of stress, men tend toward more risk taking than women
    - adolescence is mostly about taking risk and seeking new experiences
  - **Us / Them**
    - Oxytocin exaggerates Us/Them-ing (forgiving Us more readily than Them)
    - ```most exquisitely happy moments of my life have come from feeling like an Us, feeling accepted and not alone, safe and understood, feeling part of something enveloping and larger than myself, filled with a sense of being on the right side```
    - "Belonging is safety"
- **Children**
  - when experiencing childhood adversity amygdala can develop the ability to inhibit frontal cortex
  - exposure to violent media can increese agression levels soon after
  - heavy childhood exposure to media violence **predicts** higher levels of aggression in young adults HOWEVER there are no eveidence that extremally violent people (mass shooters) are because of media agression
- **Culture**
  - individualism / collectivism
    - US/Europe vs East Asian: `Americans are more likely than East Asians to remember times in which they influenced someone; conversely, East Asians are more likely to remember times when someone influenced them` and `mesolimbic dopamine systems activate in European Americans when looking at excited facial expressions; in Chinese, when looking at calm expressions`
    - correlation of individual (northern China) vs collective farming with individualist vs collectivist culture markers
  - inequality
    - stratified cultures might be a good survival strategy: `when times are tough, the unequal access to wealth becomes the unequal distribution of misery and death` (another strategry: hunter-gatherers pick up and move)
    - it is feeling poor (comparing to other people) what's predicts poor health
    - beeing exposed on social inequality raises violense levels within your (lower) class
  - population density
    - it exaggerates preexisting social tendencies, high-density makes aggressive individuals more aggressive (similar to testosterone, alcohol, media violence), it also makes unaggressive individuals more shy and fearful
  - politics
    - `people become more conservative when tired, in pain or distracted with a cognitive task, or when blood alcohol levels rise.`
    - "rightists" statistacily are more likely to respect hierarchy, don't like new ideas, take given circumstances as a threat
    - "conservatism" associated with an enlarged amygdala (threat perception)
    - "liberalism" associated with larger amounts of gray matter (empathy) and higher amygdala activation for disgust and taking risk
- **Religion**
  - desert cultures -> monotheistic religions, rain forest cultures -> polytheistic religions
  - `once cultures get large enough that anonymous acts are possible, they start inventing moralizing gods`
- **Evolution**
  - is not gradual (S. J. Gould) - there is some buffer require for changes to start occuring, after some events it goes faster
