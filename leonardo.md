- Leonardo was outsider in many areas
- Vinci was his home vilige
- he was connecting arts with engeneering (like many people during his time)
- he was making plenty of notes / todos / questions
- mirror writting - because he was left-handed
- painting: he knew how to show dynamics of movement
- many unfished "projects" (huge horse statue, chaning river flows, smart cities, war machines, many paintings)
- "advices" from Leonardo
  - be courios, be critical
  - plan experiments
  - search for analogies
  - visualize things, processes
  - in observation, start from detail
  - create TODO lists & make notes
  - not everything must be fully-described (be open to uncertainty!)
  - don't be afraid to leave some work unfinished
  - cooperate with your community
